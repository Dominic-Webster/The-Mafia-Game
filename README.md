- Doctor: Every night, you can save one person from death. Work with the village to eliminate the killers.
- Detective: Every night, you can investigate one person to learn their role. Work with the village to eliminate the killers.
- Cop: You have two bullets. Every night, you can choose to shoot a player. However, shooting at an innocent will result in your death instead, so shoot wisely. Work with the village to eliminate the killers.

- Fool: Chaos is your game. You only win if you are executed in court.
